Write an AI to rank web pages by importance.

When search engines like Google display search results, they do so by placing more “important” and higher-quality pages higher in the search results than less important pages. 
For that reason, the PageRank algorithm was created by Google’s co-founders. In PageRank’s algorithm, a website is more important if it is linked to by other important websites, and links from less important websites have their links weighted less. This definition seems a bit circular, but it turns out that there are multiple strategies for calculating these rankings.
